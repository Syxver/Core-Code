### 1- Java language is compiled or interpreted? (El lenguaje Java es compilado o interpretado?) ## 
Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter. (Java se puede considerar tanto un lenguaje compilado como interpretado porque su código fuente se compila primero en un código de bytes binario. Este código de bytes se ejecuta en la máquina virtual de Java (JVM), que suele ser un intérprete basado en software.)
### 2- Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD ##
1- find out how much my currency is worth in USD
2- In my case my local currency is USD but as an example lempiras will be used and 1 Lempira is equivalent to 0.041 USD
3- Now if I want to know how many USD I have in HNL, the following will be done:
   1- Have my exact number in HNL
   2- Multiply this figure by 0.041
   3- The result of said multiplication would be my amount of Lempiras in Dollars
Example
I have 350 HNL and I want to know how much it is in USD I do the following:
350 * 0.041 = 14.35

### 3- Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022) ##
1- Start
2- Variable X = Year of birth
3- Variable Y = Current year
4- Variable Z = Y - X
5- Show Z and say Age "Z"
6- End
### 4- Why are flowcharts important to us as developers? ##
